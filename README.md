## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time,  keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](roadmap.jpg)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instnance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```

## Live demo

You can find a running system to test at [callforcode.mybluemix.net](http://callforcode.mybluemix.net/)

## Built with

* [IBM Cloud Annotations](https://cloud.annotations.ai/login) - The open source image annotation tool for image classification
* [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/) - The conversation AI platform for chatbot

Add other stufffffffff if relevant
